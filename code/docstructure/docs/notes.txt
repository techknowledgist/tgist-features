Little write-up of some of the changes made to John's code from July 2nd 2012

Overall:
- Some minor style changes (see Python styleguide), most notably adding spaces around the
assignment operator (but not if it is used for keywords) and after commas.

main.py:
- Fixed convert_files for the case where it takes a file list
- Moved data-specific code (reading and printing) to sections.py. The deal is that code in
this file should be mostly oblivious to what the actual data are. The only exception is th
ecode that determines what section factory to use.

sections.py:
- General refactoring, using classes for each text type

med_read.py:
- __repr__() is used to create a string that when evaluated creates a the object, in this case
use __str__() instead.
