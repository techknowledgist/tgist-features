There are two kinds of Chinese patents:

Look at the directory in 

/Users/marc/Documents/FUSE/data/fuse-patents/500-patents/DATA/Lexis-Nexis/CN/Xml/

Most patents are in the following format:

     2005/CN1229153C.xml

They have two subsections of description that are useful:

     <description id="descr_chi" lang="chi" format="original" date-changed="20091229">
     		  <technical-field>...</technical-field>
		  <background-art>...</background-art>
		  <disclosure>...</disclosure>
		  <description-of-drawings>...</description-of-drawings>
		  <mode-for-invention>...</mode-for-invention>
	</description>

But since 2011 this changed (see desciption1.jpg):
       
       2011/CN101978588A.xml

Here you should look at the first and third paragraph because the string there encodes
technical-field and background-art:

technical-field 技术领域
background-art 背景技术

Sometimes they are not in a separate <p> but in the beginning of a <p> with a space after them.

And sometimes they are a bit longer (eg 所属技术领域)



Note that there are two abstracts, we now miss one of them

And note that something seems to go wrong with the claims section
